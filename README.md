# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

<b>CSC 578</b>: Course focuses on the algorithms, implement, and application of neural networks for learning about data. <br>
It will present how neural networks represent data and learn in supervised and unsupervised contexts with applications to language processing, classification, and regression problems. <br>
Topics include learning algorithms, and optimization methods, deep learning methods for deriving deep representations from surface features, recursive networks, Boltzmann machines and convolutional networks.
